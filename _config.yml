# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

mermaid:
  # Version of mermaid library
  # Pick an available version from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/
  version: "9.1.6"
  # Put any additional configuration, such as setting the theme, in _includes/mermaid_config.js
  # See also docs/ui-components/code
  # To load mermaid from a local library, also use the `path` key to specify the location of the library; e.g.
  # for (v10+):
  # path: "/assets/js/mermaid.esm.min.mjs"
  # for (<v10):
  # path: "/assets/js/mermaid.min.js"
  # Note: copy both `mermaid.esm.min.mjs` (v10+) or `mermaid.min.js` (<v10) and the associated `.map` file from the specified version of `mermaid/dist` to `/assets/js/`.
