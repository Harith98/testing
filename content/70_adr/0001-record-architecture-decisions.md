# 0001 Record architecture decisions
Date: 2023-12-22

## Status
Accepted
{: .label .label-green }

## Context
We need to record the architectural decisions and also general decisions made for a particular project or for the team.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions){:target="_blank"}. The [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools){:target="_blank"} could help us to create adr records

## Consequences
See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools){:target="_blank"}.
