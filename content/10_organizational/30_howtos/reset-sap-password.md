## Reset password of personal user
If you need to reset your password for your 422 SAP user, follow these instructions in [ServiceNow](https://bbraunp.service-now.com/serviceportal?sys_kb_id=104b44d1db4eb0d0b30494d3f39619f7&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=1&sysparm_tsqueryId=ac22338fdb2ac654b30494d3f39619fc){:target="_blank"}.

## Reset password of communication user
If you need to reset the password for one of our MuleSoft SAP communication users (service users), create a Service Request in [ServiceNow](https://bbraunp.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=47d734ef795e24002ab1e1095445005e&sysparm_category=null&catalog_id=-1){:target="_blank"}.

A service request must also be submitted if a communication user needs to be unlocked (stating the user name and the SAP system concerned).
