## Sprint Availablitiy
In order to estimate the sprint capacity, we need to know how many working days each team member has available within a sprint. We use this [Excel template](https://bbraun.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/bbraun_eis_mulesoftit/Internal%20Documents/Capacity%20Planning/Capacity.xlsx?d=w0b8590c1c9b44c7f898a57f713bca21c&csf=1&web=1&e=cMkJDC){:target="_blank"} for recording. Please record your availability before the start of the sprint.

##  Vacation Checklist

**Before** going to vacation, please **always check**

- [ ] Your vacation is properly entered in the MuleSoft Outlook calendar 
- [ ] There are no assigned tickets to you in the current sprint (your Todo and In Progress column must be empty) / Handover pending tickets to other team members before vacation
- [ ] There are no PRs assigned to you for review
- [ ] You will not be on support week duty during your holiday. In this case, please swap with someone else from the team.
